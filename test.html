<h1>US Banking Crisis: Impact of SVB and Signature Bank Collapse</h1>\n<p>The recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank has caused a global slump in bank shares, leading to concern about the banking crisis in the US.</p>\n<p>President Biden has stated that Americans' money is safe, and those with bank accounts at the two collapsed banks have been guaranteed that their deposits are secure by the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, and the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC).</p>\n<p>Bank shares across the US, Asia, and Europe slumped following SVB and Signature Bank's collapse, leading many to worry about the general state of the banking sector. Smaller US lenders were particularly affected, although they rallied on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>SVB was a key lender for early-stage businesses, and its collapse led to concerns about the knock-on impact on many industries, from climate tech to medical research. UK tech firms who were customers of SVB were also concerned that they could go bust without help.</p>\n<p>So, how bad is the crisis, and what are the wider ramifications?</p>\n<h2>Will Other Banks Be Affected?</h2>\n<p>While some investors are speculating that the failures of SVB and Signature Bank could be a sign of troubles at other firms, most banks spread their exposure across many sectors and have plenty of cash on hand, minimizing the risk to the rest of the banking sector.</p>\n<p>The fact that both banks had overly concentrated business models and were exposed to assets under pressure from rising interest rates highlighted the fact that many banks are riskier than they might appear, leading to the recent slump in bank shares.</p>\n<h2>What Is The Impact on Bank Customers?</h2>\n<p>If you bank somewhere other than the two collapsed banks, your money will not be affected. Even people with bank accounts at SVB and Signature Bank are now guaranteed by the US government that all their funds are safe.</p>\n<p>The issue of bank bailouts is a toxic one in the US, but American regulators have created a new lending program that allows banks facing similar problems to use their financial assets to get a loan from the Federal Reserve, which acts as a backstop to ensure banks can meet their depositors' needs. The fees that banks pay into the Deposit Insurance Fund cover any losses incurred, with customers ultimately taking on these costs.</p>\n<h2>How Will Rising Interest Rates Impact The Banking Crisis?</h2>\n<p>Rising interest rates were partly to blame for the crisis, with the Federal Reserve aggressively raising them to slow down the economy, but this has led to persistent high inflation rates. There is now a general nervousness about where the next crisis caused by rising rates could turn up. Financial analysts speculate that the Federal Reserve may stop hiking rates in response to recent events or even start cutting them, but there is no clear playbook for this situation as it is unchartered territory.</p>\n<p>While the wider impact of the current banking crisis is yet to be seen, efforts are underway to minimize its impact on customers and businesses. </p>
